"Dynprog":https://github.com/kedarbellare/dynprog is a generic dynamic programming toolkit that extends the "unsupervised modeling toolkit":http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pliang/software/unsupervised-modeling-1.0.zip written by Percy Liang. It depends on "tools":https://github.com/kedarbellare/tools and also on the "optimization":http://code.google.com/p/pr-toolkit package from the posterior regularization toolkit written by Joao Graca.
