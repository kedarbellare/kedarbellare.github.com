Previously, I was a graduate student pursuing my M.S/Ph.D in <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu">Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.umass.edu">University of Massachusetts, Amherst</a> (UMass). Prior to UMass, I completed my undergraduate studies (B.Tech) at <a href="http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/"><span class="caps">IIT</span> Bombay</a> in 2004.

I worked in the <a href="http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/">Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory</a> (<span class="caps">IESL</span>) where I applied machine learning techniques to problems in information extraction and natural language processing. My advisor was Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Andrew McCallum</a>.
