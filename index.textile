I am a graduate student pursuing my M.S/Ph.D in "Computer Science":http://www.cs.umass.edu at "University of Massachusetts, Amherst":http://www.umass.edu (UMass).

Prior to UMass, I completed my undergraduate studies (B.Tech) at "IIT Bombay":http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/ in 2004. 

Currently, I am working in the "Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory":http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/ (IESL). 

My advisor is Prof. "Andrew McCallum":http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/. 

I apply machine learning techniques to problems in information extraction and natural language processing.
